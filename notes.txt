Ideas on creating actual, mappable/mapped 2D dungeon:
- Each passage segment can be stored as a 2D text string representing the open spaces and connection points
- Or they could be represented by instruction, more dynamically handling things like passage width
- Chambers make a lot of sense handled dynamically, though non-rectangular rooms become quite tricky
- Could do both, having the trickier stuff be handled manually
- I need to be able to rotate whatever I end up with
- There probably needs to be a giant 2D array keeping track of everything, so collision detection can work out.
- Ideally there should also be a structure that keeps track of each room/corridor and linking doors, etc.
- I wonder if I should fish out some of my procedural home generation logic, as it did some similar stuff.
